1. INTRODUCTION:

This Geo-AceKG DATA consists of a collection of triplets (synset, relation_type, 
triplet) extracted from WordNet 3.0 (http://wordnet.princeton.edu). This data set can 
be seen as a 3-mode tensor depicting ternary relationships between synsets. 


2. CONTENT:

The data archive contains 6 files:
  - README 3K
  - train.txt 6,8M
  - valid.txt 868K
  - test.txt 870K

The 3 files (train.txt, valid.txt and test.txt) contain the triplets (training, validation
and test sets).


3. DATA FORMAT

All 3 files (train.txt, valid.txt and test.txt) contain one triplet per line, with 2 synset_ids 
and relation type identifier in a tab separated format. The first element is the 
synset_id of the left hand side of the relation triple, the third one is the 
synset_id of the right hand side and the second element is the name of the type 
of relations between them.


4. DATA STATISTICS

There are 16,363 synsets and 10 relation types among them. The training set contains 
121,329 triplets, the validation set 15,167 and the test set 15,166.

All triplets are unique and we made sure that all synsets appearing in
the validation or test sets were occurring in the training set.

5. HOW TO CITE

When using this data, one should cite the original paper:
  @article{bordes-mlj13,
    title = {A Semantic Matching Energy Function for Learning with Multi-relational Data},
    author = {Antoine Bordes and Xavier Glorot and Jason Weston and Yoshua Bengio},
    journal={Machine Learning},
    publisher={Springer},
